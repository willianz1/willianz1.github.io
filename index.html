<p class="information">Hello! I am a young adult pursuing my dreams as a software Engineer. I have been coding since 2016 with  learning the basic concept of HTML5 and CSS3. I like to say that there is always room for learning, and with coding I can definitely say that there is never a dull moment. I am constantly learning new abilities/languages and can't wait to put them to the test and become a fully stacked devloper!</p>
